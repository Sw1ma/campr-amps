# Contributing

Testing is an important part of the app development process, so I aim to ensure a smooth and successful experience. For that I partnered with App Center, a third-party service, to continuous integrate, deliver, and test.

Read my [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Sw1ma/campr-amps/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and go to [Getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/testers/) at App Center for a detailed explanation on how to become a beta tester. Get invited by sending me an [email](mailto:community@easycamperapps.com) and receive a link to download the app.  

Thanks for joining and helping improve Campr Amps!
